    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A perfectly seared steak, caramelized on the outside with a rich,
        smoky crust, and tender, juicy inside that melts in your mouth.
        With each bite, a burst of savory umami flavor, balanced by a hint
        of char, offers a satisfying depth. The subtle richness of the meat
        is complemented by a touch of butter and fresh garlic, making each
        mouthful irresistible.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Filet Mignon steak (6-12 oz each)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 sprig of fresh rosemary or thyme (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil (for searing)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Fresh ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Steak:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the <strong>Filet Mignon</strong> from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking to
                    bring it to room temperature. This helps the steak cook more evenly.</li>
                <li>Pat the steak dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. This ensures a good sear.</li>
                <li>Season both sides of the steak generously with <strong>kosher salt</strong> and <strong>fresh ground
                        black pepper</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Preheat the Pan:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat for about 2-3 minutes. You want
                    the pan to be hot to create a nice sear on the steak.</li>
                <li>Add 1 tablespoon of <strong>olive oil</strong> to the pan, swirling to coat the surface.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Sear the Steak:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the seasoned steak in the hot pan. Let it cook undisturbed for 3-4 minutes on the first side
                    until a deep brown crust forms.</li>
                <li>Flip the steak and cook the other side for another 3-4 minutes for medium-rare (adjust time for your
                    preferred doneness: 5-6 minutes for medium, 7-8 minutes for medium-well).</li>
                <li><strong>Tip:</strong> For extra flavor, add the <strong>garlic</strong> and <strong>herb
                        sprig</strong> (rosemary or thyme) to the pan in the last minute of cooking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Add Butter and Aromatics:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In the last 1-2 minutes of cooking, add 1 tablespoon of <strong>unsalted butter</strong> to the pan.
                    As it melts, tilt the pan slightly and spoon the butter over the steak to baste it. This will add
                    richness and flavor.</li>
                <li>The garlic and herbs should infuse the butter, creating a fragrant, flavorful glaze.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Rest the Steak:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Once your steak reaches your desired doneness, remove it from the pan and place it on a plate. Let
                    it rest for 5 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute throughout the meat.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>After resting, slice against the grain (if desired) and serve with your favorite sidesâ€”like roasted
                    vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a simple salad.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
