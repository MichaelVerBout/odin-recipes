    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A perfectly seared steak, caramelized on the outside with a rich,
        smoky crust, and tender, juicy inside that melts in your mouth.
        With each bite, a burst of savory umami flavor, balanced by a hint
        of char, offers a satisfying depth. The subtle richness of the meat
        is complemented by a touch of butter and fresh garlic, making each
        mouthful irresistible.
