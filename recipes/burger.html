    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the Ingredients:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Slice the <strong>white onion</strong> into thin rings.</li>
                <li>Slice the <strong>pickles</strong> into thin rounds.</li>
                <li>Slice the <strong>Habanero Cheddar Cheese</strong> into thin slices for easy melting.</li>
                <li>Preheat your grill or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Season the Beef Patties:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a bowl, season the <strong>ground beef</strong> with <strong>spicy garlic seasoning</strong>,
                    <strong>rosemary & roasted garlic seasoning</strong>, and a generous pinch of <strong>fine ground
                    Malabar black pepper</strong>. Mix until well combined, but donâ€™t overwork the meat.</li>
                <li>Divide the seasoned beef into even portions and shape them into patties, making them slightly larger
                    than your <strong>brioche buns</strong> to account for shrinkage while cooking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Cook the Burgers:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Lightly oil your grill or skillet to prevent sticking. Place the patties on the grill or skillet and
                    cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.</li>
                <li>In the last minute of cooking, place a slice of <strong>Habanero Cheddar Cheese</strong> on each
                    patty to melt.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Caramelize the Onions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a small pan, add a little oil over medium heat. Add the <strong>white onion</strong> rings and
                    cook for about 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they become soft and caramelized.</li>
                <li>Drizzle in a bit of <strong>balsamic vinegar</strong> and continue cooking for another minute until
                    the vinegar evaporates and the onions are glossy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Toast the Buns:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>While the burgers are cooking, slice the <strong>brioche buns</strong> in half. Toast them lightly
                    on the grill or in a separate pan until golden brown.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Assemble the Burger:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the bottom half of each toasted <strong>brioche bun</strong> on a plate.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked burger patty with melted <strong>Habanero Cheddar Cheese</strong> on top.</li>
                <li>Layer with the <strong>caramelized onions</strong> and <strong>pickle slices</strong>.</li>
                <li>Top with the other half of the toasted bun.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Serve your spicy, flavorful burger with a side of fries, chips, or a crisp salad. Enjoy the perfect
                    balance of heat, savory richness, and tangy sweetness!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
