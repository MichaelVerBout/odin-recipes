# odin-recipes

A basic recipe website project. By completing this project I have demonstrated understanding of how to write basic html webpages with proper boilerplate. Further, I have experience linking between pages and utilizing image based graphics within my webpages. Finally, I have shown comprehension of ordered/unordered lists and when to use them.
